(halo...) halo-o\n\n(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o\n\n(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo... uhoo\n\n\n\nHit me like a ray of sun\n\nBurning through my darkest nights\n\nYou're the only one that I want\n\nThink I'm addicted to your light\n\n\n\nI swore I'd never fall again\n\nBut this don't even feel like fallin'\n\nGravity can't forget\n\nTo pull me back to the ground again\n\n\n\nIt's like I've been awakened\n\nEvery rule I had you breakin'\n\nIt's the risk that I'm takin'\n\nI ain't never gonna shut you out\n\n\n\nEverywhere I'm looking now\n\nI'm surrounded by your embrace\n\nBaby I can see you halo\n\nYou know you're my saving grace\n\nYou're everything I need and more\n\nIt's written all over you face\n\nBaby I can feel your halo\n\nPray it won't fade away (#)\n\n\n\n(I can feel your halo... halo...) halo\n\n(I can see your) halo...
